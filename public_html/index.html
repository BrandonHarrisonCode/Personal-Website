                        <h4>About</h4>
                        I'm Brandon Harrison.  I was born in Dallas, Texas, went to school in Austin, and I now live a slightly more vertical life in Fort Collins, Colorado.  I work for Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a DevOps Infrastructure Automation Engineer.  I spend a lot of time tinkering around with my Linux machines and automating anything that takes longer than 30 seconds.  In my freetime I backpack, woodwork, homebrew, rock climb, and ski whenever the mountains are a little frosty.
